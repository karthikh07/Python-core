QUEUE:

1>DATA STRUCTURE
2>ALGORITHM
3>LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE
4>FIFO (FIRST IN FIRST OUT)


OPEATIONS:
1>INSERTION
2>DELETION





Operations possible on the queue are:

1>En-queue or add an element to the end of the queue
2>De-queue or remove an element from the front of the queue




OPEATIONS:
1>INSERTION
2>DELETION




1>INSERTION FROM REAR
2>DELETION FROM FRONT



FRONT WILL ALWAYS POINTING TO THE FIRST LOCATION
INITIALLY REAR WILL ALSO BE POINTING TO FIRST LOCATION IF THERE IS NO ELEMENT IN THE LIST.


F=0
R=0




WE WILL ALWAYS INSERT USING THE REAR VARIABLE
AFTER INSERTING RARE VALUE IS CHANGED.
